Note: unnamed-rs won't build in its current state because it is missing vendor headers in the cpp/include directory.

TODO: license & project info.

This wasn't intended to be a vague repository published just before the deadline, but I'm bad with deadlines, so that's what it is for now. 

The directory unnamed-compat only contains old/unused gradle modifications and some very trivial robot code, but it's included because it's the counterpart of unnamed-rs. (This will make more sense once it's not called unnamed-rs and I have time to explain what it is)
